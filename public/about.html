<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>From ensuring safety and efficacy of medicines, because let's face it, no one wants to end up with superpowers from their medicines, to realize that my true calling lay in another fieldâ€”the field of zeros and ones and lines of code. ðŸ’ŠðŸ’»</p>

<p>  For me programming is like solving challenges and I do like to be challenged and losing the sense of time trying to solve it.. So, what would you do if you found something exciting that you could work on? Obviously, you run after it and thatâ€™s what I did! ðŸ’¡</p>

<p>Are you looking for a curious and hardworking software developer passionate about challenges? Here I am, ping me! âœ¨ðŸš€</p>
